ezDRTtools is derived from the pyDRTtools program created by the lab of Dr. Francesco Ciucci. https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/francesco-ciucci

pyDRTtools is an open-source program to calculate the Distribution of Relaxation Times (DRT) from impedance data. These techniques have been expanded over many iterations of the program. The full source code can be downloaded and installed from https://github.com/ciuccislab/pyDRTtools. Because the program is written in Python, it is necessary to install a Python environment and its associated libraries. 

The ezDRTtools app from Scribner LLC is designed to simplify the installation using a single download and requires no knowledge of Python. It also provides additions such as a desktop icon to launch the application. Scribner has also added new functions to ZView to export data in specific format required by pyDRTtools/ezDRTtools.
